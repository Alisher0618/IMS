## Task - T2: SHO Model of production in the food industry
Choose a food production enterprise (small, medium, large). Create its model focused on its complete production activity (ie suitable for companies with a limited range of production) or one important product and its production process (line, material flow, collaboration with employees). Show weak points of operation on experiments. Propose changes in operation (line structure changes, capacity changes, etc.).
